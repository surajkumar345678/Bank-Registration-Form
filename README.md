# Universal Bank Online Banking Registration Form

This repository contains the code for an online banking registration form for Universal Bank. The form allows users to register for online banking services by providing their account details, username, password, and other necessary information.

## Description

The `index.html` file contains the HTML code for the registration form. It includes input fields for account number, CIF number, username, password, country, and options to select account type and transaction rights.

The `style.css` file provides the CSS styling for the form, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly layout. Media queries are used to adjust the layout for different screen sizes, making the form responsive.

Additionally, the `script.js` file contains JavaScript functions for password validation and form submission. The `checkPassword()` function compares the entered password with the confirmed password and displays a message accordingly. The `callValue()` function retrieves values from the form fields and prints them on the screen.

## Features

- Input validation for mandatory fields (e.g., account number, CIF number, username, password)
- Dropdown menus for selecting account type and country
- Radio buttons for selecting transaction rights
- Password strength validation (minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters)
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices
